## Welcome to the [RocketSockets](https://rocketsockets.network/) Documentation

### Configuration & QuickStart

To start RocketSockets, start the binary provided for your platform in a shell. RocketSockets will automatically start 1 WebSockets server on the port indicated in [appsettings.json]({{site.baseurl}}{% link appsettings.md %}).

To start additional WebSockets servers, use the `StartWebSocketsServer [port]` command.

To stop WebSockets servers, use the `StopWebSocketsServer [port]` command.

Make sure that your "Unity Binary Connection Port" matches in both Unity and `appsettings.json.`
